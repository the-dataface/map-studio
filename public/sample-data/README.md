# Sample Data Files

This directory contains CSV files used as sample datasets for the Map Studio app's data input panel. These files are used to populate the popover sample data options for symbol and choropleth maps, covering the US, Canada, and the world.

- `symbol-us.csv`: US companies (symbol map)
- `symbol-world.csv`: World cities (symbol map)
- `symbol-canada.csv`: Canadian companies/cities (symbol map)
- `choropleth-us.csv`: US states (choropleth map, all 50 states + DC)
- `choropleth-canada.csv`: Canadian provinces/territories (choropleth map, all 13)
- `choropleth-world.csv`: World countries (choropleth map, broad coverage)

All files are ready to be loaded and visualized in the app. Columns are chosen to support color/size mapping and geocoding where appropriate.
